# cpp-code-init

Always wanted to quickly run some c++ code, hardly code gets right in first attempt so naturally you tend to recompile your code again and again which is tedious, addressing this common problem which we face quite oftenly I created this CLI package which auto compiles your cpp code every time you save.


# Get started
### Prerequisites:
- Make sure that you have g++ compiler installed in your local machine
  - to check if g++ is installed enter `g++ --version` if installed you can see the version of g++
  - else you can install it from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)
- NPM minimum version 5.2+ is required

### Installation
open a termainal and enter `npx cpp-code-init`, after it runs successfully follow the instructions shown in console

**Note:**
The code in main.cpp uses input.txt to take input and shows output to output.txt, I found it quite useful in competetive programming you can just put the input from the problem statement into input.txt and output will be shown in ouput.txt every time you save main.cpp or input.txt
